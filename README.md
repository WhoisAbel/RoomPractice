# RoomPractice
I'm starting a new project  about ROOM database with Kotlin. This current project will be all about creating a Database schema for our projects. then you noticed how hard is it to create and manage one database. But with ROOM library everything is easier! ROOM library is built on top of SQliteOpenHelper class.
