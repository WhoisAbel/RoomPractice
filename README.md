# RoomPractice
I'm starting a new project  about ROOM database with Kotlin. This tutorial serie will have 5 videos. This current video will be all about creating a Database schema for our projects. then you noticed how hard is it to create and manage one database. But with ROOM library everything is easier! ROOM library is built on top of SQliteOpenHelper class.
